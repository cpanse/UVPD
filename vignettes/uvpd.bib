  abstract = {Optimizing methods for liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a non-trivial task. Here we present rawDiag, a software tool supporting rational method optimization by providing MS operator-tailored diagnostic plots of scan level metadata. rawDiag is implemented as R package and can be executed on the command line, or through a graphical user interface (GUI) for less experienced users. The code runs platform independent and can process a hundred raw files in less than three minutes on current consumer hardware as we show by our benchmark. In order to demonstrate the functionality of our package, we included a real-world example taken from our daily core facility business. The R package itself, a shiny demo application, and a Dockerfile that builds the entire architecture from scratch is accessible through a GitHub repository, see https://github.com/protViz/rawDiag},
